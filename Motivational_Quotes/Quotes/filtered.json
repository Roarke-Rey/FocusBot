They\u2019re there to stop the other people.","7006":"The grand essentials to happiness in this life are something to do, something to love, and something to hope for.","7019":"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.","7023":"Do no harm and leave the world a better place than you found it.","7047":"When things break, it's not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again.

You're going to miss life. You've got to jump off the cliff all the time and build your wings on the way down.","7422":"Inspirational leaders need to have a winning mentality in order to inspire respect.

It's what they want.","7467":"The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.","7472":"We can't be afraid of change. You may feel very secure in the pond that you are in, but if you never venture out of it, you will never know that there is such a thing as an ocean, a sea.

You have to go after it with a club.","7566":"There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people.

Out, out, brief candle!Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.","7686":"Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.","7700":"I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.","7728":"A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.","7730":"When Maurice touched a keyboard, it was like something from a movie, magical.

The desire to reach hearts is wise.","7879":"I want to be motivational and inspirational for everybody: my big aim is more women on bicycles.","7883":"Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure. But it was actually really important for me to go through that.

But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.","7922":"The most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than our suffering.","7940":"Business gives you a massive high. Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution... It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.","7952":"Like the United Nations, there is something inspirational about New York as a great melting pot of different cultures and traditions. And if this is the city that never sleeps, the United Nations works tirelessly, around the clock around the world.","7960":"There will be a few times in your life when all your instincts will tell you to do something, something that defies logic, upsets your plans, and may seem crazy to others. When that happens, you do it. Listen to your instincts and ignore everything else. Ignore logic, ignore the odds, ignore the complications, and just go for it.","7967":"Since we launched the original 'Pop Idol' in England, I've remained close with Simon Fuller. Working as executive producer on 'American idol' for its first seven years not only was an inspirational journey into the heart of American pop culture, it opened my eyes to the untapped potential of the incredibly dynamic young people in this world.","7976":"No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dreams that you wish will come true.","7977":"The real heroes anyway aren't the people doing things; the real heroes are the people NOTICING things, paying attention.","7981":"I think if there's something one needs to change with oneself, it doesn't have to happen in the New Year.

But it's also up to engineering to make itself more interesting.","8017":"It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.","8019":"Never look back unless you are planning to go that way.","8022":"Personally, I can't see the appeal in trekking down to D.C. for a networking extravaganza, even if it is built around a special moment in American history. While I find the election of Barack Obama inspirational, I don't have a desire to memorialize it with overly effusive celebration.","8033":"One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff.
